# React / Redux Github Resume

---

## About

This is basic demo project using React / Redux (based on React Redux Universal Hot boilerplate) which loads in a hithub users basic profile information, and provides some specs on their open repos.

## Installation

For more information on setting up this project please refer to the [React Redux Universal Hot boilerplate github page](https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example).

```bash
npm install
```

## Running Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The first time it may take a little while to generate the first `webpack-assets.json` and complain with a few dozen `[webpack-isomorphic-tools] (waiting for the first Webpack build to finish)` printouts, but be patient. Give it 30 seconds.
